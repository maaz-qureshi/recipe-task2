        Wash and boil ½ kg potatoes. Once they are boiled peel them and mash them with a fork. Boil 250 gm beef with 1 tbsp white vinegar and salt. Then chop it in the chopper. Now mix in chopped beef, poatatoes, crushed black pepper, 1 tsp crushed and roasted cumin seeds, 1 tbsp corn flour, 2 tbsp rice flour, salt to taste and chopped green chilies together. Grease your hands and make kababs. Dip them in egg and shallow fry them. Once they are golden brown take them out and keep them aside. Now grease the pan and toast 6 burger buns. Put some sandwich spread and milk on the buns. Put kabab on it and add in some tomato ketchup and chili garlic sauce. Cut it from the middle and serve.
